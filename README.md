An open-source blog site made using GatsbyJS that delivers information about tech-related topics and my portfolio site.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

* [node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

1. Open your terminal on the root of the project and run the yarn command to install all the node packages.

```
yarn
```

## Deployment

### Running the server in a production environment

The package.json has a script called build that you can run using:

```
yarn build
```

This will create all the resources neccesary to pack the website

### Running the server in a local environment for tests

The package.json has another command called develop that you can run using:

```
yarn develop
```

This will run a development server on your localhost:8000 and localhost:8000/___graphql.
