## What is Web Accessibility?

Web Development is a relatively new field and it has made major advancements over the years. Something that seems to be rather overlooked is web accessibility but what is it? Web accessibility is designing your website or web application in such a way that people with disabilities can use it.

Many websites are near impossible to use due to not taking this into account. There is also the problem that this is currently not being covered in college, boot camps or beginner tutorials leading to bad practices on developers. This can also lead to loss of business or possible lawsuit because of the Americans Disabilities Act (ADA). This is a good resource for the [number of lawsuits over accessibility](https://www.adatitleiii.com/2019/01/number-of-federal-website-accessibility-lawsuits-nearly-triple-exceeding-2250-in-2018/)

By not making your app accessible you are creating barriers for users to use your application where everybody should be able to. Also just think the last time you were on a slow or dysfunctional website that made you scream with frustration. This is what people feel when your app is not accessible. Be a good developer and don't create barriers but build bridges to connect everybody.
