`Software is the language of automation. Jensen Huang`

When I first installed Linux (Ubuntu) for my work I felt such a rush automating the process of installing packages on a fresh installation.
I kept finding things to automate on my computer and on my home making me focus more on the fun stuff.
Even on videogames I get obsessed over automating processes playing games that feed that need.

Automation is everywhere, sometimes we don't even notice.
This can be a very scary subject since the first thing I think about is how it can replace jobs making unemployment a very big problem.
This fear is not misplaced since studies have reached this conclusion.

*"From 1990 to 2007, the study shows, adding one additional robot per 1,000 workers reduced the national employment-to-population ratio by about 0.2 percent, with some areas of the U.S. affected far more than others.
This means each additional robot added in manufacturing replaced about 3.3 workers nationally, on average.
That increased use of robots in the workplace also lowered wages by roughly 0.4 percent during the same time period." (Science Daily, 2020)*

We must then ask the question how does automation benefit and harm society.
By knowing that we can move forward making sure our future is not as grim as movies like Terminator or Wall-E.
We are going to cover the following things:

1. What is Automation
2. Automation History with examples
3. Automation in it's current state
4. The possible future of automation
5. Pros and cons of automation
6. Tutorials on how to automate the installation process for Linux and Windows
