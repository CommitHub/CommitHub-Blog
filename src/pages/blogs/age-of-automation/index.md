`Software is the language of automation. Jensen Huang`

When I first installed Linux (Ubuntu) for my work I felt such a rush automating the process of installing packages on a fresh installation.
I kept finding things to automate in my computer and in my homemaking me focus more on the fun stuff.
Even on videogames, I get obsessed over automating processes playing games that feed that need.

Automation is everywhere, sometimes we don't even notice.
This can be a very scary subject since the first thing I think about is how it can replace jobs making unemployment a very big problem.
This fear is not misplaced since studies have reached this conclusion.

*"From 1990 to 2007, the study shows, adding one additional robot per 1,000 workers reduced the national employment-to-population ratio by about 0.2 percent, with some areas of the U.S. affected far more than others.
This means each additional robot added in manufacturing replaced about 3.3 workers nationally, on average.
That increased use of robots in the workplace also lowered wages by roughly 0.4 percent during the same time period." (Science Daily, 2020)*

We must then ask the question of how does automation benefit and harm society.
By knowing that we can move forward making sure our future is not as grim as movies like Terminator or Wall-E.
We are going to cover the following things:

1. What is Automation
2. Automation History with examples
3. Automation in its current state
4. The possible future of automation
5. Pros and cons of automation
6. Tutorials on how to automate the installation process for Linux and Windows

## What is Automation

Automation is a technique that employs technology to streamline and centralize routine tasks that require minimal or no human intervention.
They replace human labor by doing routine tasks that would be very time consuming if a human did it.
It can be simple tasks like adjusting the thermostat depending on the temperature outside to steering an airplane that has way more complex variables to deal with.
There are different types of automation:

* Basic Automation: Takes simple tasks and automatically performs them e.g.clocks, coffee machines, wash machines, etc.
* Process Automation: Manages business processes commonly done using software e.g. Invoice processing, workflow automation (Trello, Jira, etc).
* Integration Automation: After a human specifies some rules it mimics human behavior and repeats those actions. e.g. Jenkins, Docker, etc.
* Artificial Intelligence (AI) Automation: A complex level of automation that learns making decisions on past situations it has encountered e.g. smart thermostat, Roombas, etc.
* Many more...

In essence, anything you can think of that a machine does something for you automatically would be considered automation.
As you can see this is an everyday thing and it's embedded into modern society but let's take a step back and see some history of automation.

## Automation History

### The History of Industrial Automation

The first commercial steam engine was introduced in 1712 by Thomas Newcomen and it was able to transmit continuous power to a machine.
By the 19th-century steam engines were utilized to power factories of the industrial revolution.
Steam engines were able to replace sails on a ship and give us steam-powered locomotives.

In 1913, the Ford motor company introduced the assembly line to car production making the profits and production rates increase.
This assembly line was the first of it's kind reducing the car assembly from 12 hours per car to about one and a half hours per car.

Relay logic (The method of utilizing combinational logic in circuits by utilizing electrical controlled relays wired in a particular combination) was introduced to factories with electrification.
It went on a rapid adoption from 1900 through the 1920s increasing productivity in the factories.
The first and second world wars produced major advancements in the fields of mass communication and signal processing.

### The Information Age

With the development of the transistor, it made it easier to develop tools that automate processes in society.
The computer increased productivity in the workplace by automating a lot of the processes that businesses do.
It did reduce the workforce in manufacturing.
In research from Smith, (Fran. 5 Oct 2010. "Job Losses and Productivity Gains." Competitive Enterprise Institute.) `"In the United States, for example, from January 1972 to August 2010, the number of people employed in manufacturing jobs fell from 17,500,000 to 11,500,000 while manufacturing value rose 270%."`.

With the start of the information age the workforce was compelled to compete in a global market.
This change were workers were replaced by machines and having a global scope pushed workers to find jobs where they can't easily be replaced.
Those workers who lose those jobs might be pressed to move into jobs that require the use of the mind instead of their muscles e.g. engineers, doctors, lawyers, teachers, professors, scientist, executives, journalist, consultants, etc.
These type of jobs allow them to compete in this new world market with higher wages.
MIT economist Daron Acemoglu, in his study “Unpacking Skill Bias: Automation and New Tasks” he suggests that by the year 1987 was the moment when lost jobs with automation stopped being replaced by an equal number of similar workplace opportunities.

## Automation in the 21st Century

It's not surprising that automation has revolutionized the workplace.
The creation of the computer simplified the way we work.
We can't say for certain what are the consequences of automation since we are starting to see both the good and the bad.
No matter how we feel about it it's intertwined with our daily lives.
Let's take a look at some current examples of automation:

1. Employee Analytics

Using tools like Excel allow us to go through deep pools of data with minimal effort.
HR go through this year round data trying to improve workers happiness in the company.

2. Hiring Process

Automated tools are used now to go through thousands of resumes and pick the "best" candidates saving time and money.
These tools can be tricked and are not 100% accurate.
They look for specific keywords in resumes and sometimes miss excellent candidates.

3. Employee help desk support

Chatbots are becoming mainstream allowing people to find help easily without the intervention of a human.
Even if someone needs help from someone there is a huge number of tools that help report problems and help as easily as it is possible.]

4. Space

Space is a very dangerous place for humans to be in.
We send robots to do the dangerous job for us to allow humans to learn more about space without risking lives.
A great example is the Mars rover.

5. Autocorrect

This simple tool help us in our daily lives fixing our grammatical mistakes.
The more we use it the more it knows what we mean helping us in the long run.
It's not perfect. No tool is but it's an amazing aid.

6. Machine automation

I remember as a child the candy machines that you put a quarter in and it dispenses an amount of candy.
This is a form of automation that replaces the human in the equation.
On the 21st century we got Roombas that clean the house for us and many applicances making our daily lives easier.

7. Scripts

Very useful when managing multiple systems since they can automate your workflow like automatically removing unnecesary files, managing packages, sending information, etc.

8. Many more...

Take a look at our sources for more examples of automation.

## Possible Futures of Automation

Researchers have pondered upon the question for a long time and it expands multiple fields of study.
According to the study "The Future of Employment: How susceptible are jobs to computarization?" by Carl Benedikt Frey†and Michael A. Osborne they estimate, about 47 percent of total US employment is at risk
This is pretty alarming.

Science fiction has always been a medium to explore ideas.
We can ask ourselves how will our future will look like when automation keeps growing.
In his paper "Speculations on Future Relations Between Humans and Automation" Thomas B. Sheridan argues that we can follow 1 of 2 paths depending on what humanity emphazises when developing automating technology.

On the first future we design automation to maximize efficiency.
In other words machines are made to make life easier by limiting the expendeture of energy.

On the second future we design automation to selectively augment and extend our own capabilities.
Instead of making problems easier we replace our daily grind with higher order problems that enhance our experience.
We take time to explore space or focus on art.
Let's explore 2 films/shows that allows us to explore this 2 very different futures in details. Wall-E and Star Trek.

### First Future - Wall-E: We destroy earth

In this future we see that humans automate their entire lives under consummerism and cannot think for themselves.
They become soft, fat, and stupid since all their lives are surrounded by a machine that does everything for them.
Even the captain of the axiom doesn't know how to manage his ship.
Auto, the robot that manages the ship does it for him.
He is just there for appearences.
This future maximizes everybodies happiness by making it as stress free as possible by taking the whole human out of the equation.
They replace us at very important roles like the teacher relationship and it's not clear but possibly the parent child relationship.
This future is made worse because our rampent consummerism takes a hold of us and companies destroy the planet of all its resources.

### Second Future - Star Trek: We solve all of earths problem and explore the universe

A future I really want it to happen.
Poverty was solved with automation and that lead to a lot of issues being solved.
Economies are non existent and humans are tasked with exploring the universe.
This is due to the existence of the replicator that can give us access to goods without paying for them making our consumerism be taken care of.
We can observe in Star Trek The Next Generation that humans are in charge of out of the box reasoning even when having a computer with a vast amount of data.
As a species we come together to help other species out of the goodness of our hearts since we don't have to worry about working for money to eat.
Even Data who is an android does not work against us with its superior intelligence to overthrow us.
They are just part of the crew and strives to be more human.
In summary this future is where automation helps us do more of what we love instead of the stuff we hate.
