`Software is the language of automation. Jensen Huang`

When I first installed Linux (Ubuntu) for my work I felt such a rush automating the process of installing packages on a fresh installation.
I kept finding things to automate in my computer and in my homemaking me focus more on the fun stuff.
Even on videogames, I get obsessed over automating processes playing games that feed that need.

Automation is everywhere, sometimes we don't even notice.
This can be a very scary subject since the first thing I think about is how it can replace jobs making unemployment a very big problem.
This fear is not misplaced since studies have reached this conclusion.

*"From 1990 to 2007, the study shows, adding one additional robot per 1,000 workers reduced the national employment-to-population ratio by about 0.2 percent, with some areas of the U.S. affected far more than others.
This means each additional robot added in manufacturing replaced about 3.3 workers nationally, on average.
That increased use of robots in the workplace also lowered wages by roughly 0.4 percent during the same time period." (Science Daily, 2020)*

We must then ask the question of how does automation benefit and harm society.
By knowing that we can move forward making sure our future is not as grim as movies like Terminator or Wall-E.
We are going to cover the following things:

1. What is Automation
2. Automation History with examples
3. Automation in its current state
4. The possible future of automation
5. Pros and cons of automation
6. Tutorials on how to automate the installation process for Linux and Windows

## What is Automation

Automation is a technique that employs technology to streamline and centralize routine tasks that require minimal or no human intervention.
They replace human labor by doing routine tasks that would be very time consuming if a human did it.
It can be simple tasks like adjusting the thermostat depending on the temperature outside to steering an airplane that has way more complex variables to deal with.
There are different types of automation:

* Basic Automation: Takes simple tasks and automatically performs them e.g.clocks, coffee machines, wash machines, etc.
* Process Automation: Manages business processes commonly done using software e.g. Invoice processing, workflow automation (Trello, Jira, etc).
* Integration Automation: After a human specifies some rules it mimics human behavior and repeats those actions. e.g. Jenkins, Docker, etc.
* Artificial Intelligence (AI) Automation: A complex level of automation that learns making decisions on past situations it has encountered e.g. smart thermostat, Roombas, etc.
* Many more...

In essence, anything you can think of that a machine does something for you automatically would be considered automation.
As you can see this is an everyday thing and it's embedded into modern society but let's take a step back and see some history of automation.

## Automation History

### The History of Industrial Automation

The first commercial steam engine was introduced in 1712 by Thomas Newcomen and it was able to transmit continuous power to a machine.
By the 19th-century steam engines were utilized to power factories of the industrial revolution.
Steam engines were able to replace sails on a ship and give us steam-powered locomotives.

In 1913, the Ford motor company introduced the assembly line to car production making the profits and production rates increase.
This assembly line was the first of it's kind reducing the car assembly from 12 hours per car to about one and a half hours per car.

Relay logic (The method of utilizing combinational logic in circuits by utilizing electrical controlled relays wired in a particular combination) was introduced to factories with electrification.
It went on a rapid adoption from 1900 through the 1920s increasing productivity in the factories.
The first and second world wars produced major advancements in the fields of mass communication and signal processing.

### The Information Age

With the development of the transistor, it made it easier to develop tools that automate processes in society.
The computer increased productivity in the workplace by automating a lot of the processes that businesses do.
It did reduce the workforce in manufacturing.
In research from Smith, (Fran. 5 Oct 2010. "Job Losses and Productivity Gains." Competitive Enterprise Institute.) `"In the United States, for example, from January 1972 to August 2010, the number of people employed in manufacturing jobs fell from 17,500,000 to 11,500,000 while manufacturing value rose 270%."`

## Automation in the 21st Century

## Possible Futures of Automation

## Pros of Automation

* Increase in productivity and output of good
* Improvement of quality of the goods produced
* Increased consistency of the goods produced
* Reduces the cost of human labor
* Reduce cycle time in the installation of operations
* Replace a human operator on a task that involves hard or monotonous labor.
* Reduce injuries that human laborers can incur on the job.
* Replace humans in dangerous environments
* Perform tasks that are beyond human capabilities of speed, strength, endurance, intelligence, etc.
* Reduce the time of production of a good
* Frees workers to work on more important roles

## Cons of Automation

* Replaces workers by replacing them
* A high initial cost
