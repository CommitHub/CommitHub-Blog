Computers are a tool that have transformed the way we work from storing information, better processes to work with that data and allowing us to easily share the data.
The conception of this amazing tool started the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Revolution" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Digital Revolution</a>.
This lead to a race to make computers more friendly to the consumer by reducing their size as years go by.
Now in 2020 we have smartphones that have 12GB of RAM and a processor that runs at 2.5GHz.
It's truly phenomenal all the progress we have made but technology has a limit.
Let's explore first what is the classical computer to get an understanding on why quantum computers were conceived.

## Classical Computer

A classical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer" rel="noopener" target="_blank">computer</a> or just computer
(It's called classical to identify that it's a standard computer and not a quantum computer) it's a device that follows instructions to achieve a task.
With computer programming we can create logical operations pretty much telling the computer what to do and in what order.
Programs are a result of that programming that when run it follows the operations specified in the program.
The early applications of a computer were for simple calculations and in essence even computers today are just a bunch of simple calculations.

### CPU

<img class="section-jumbo" src="https://commithub.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/blog-posts/quantum-computers-explained/cpu.jpg" alt="CPU" />

Classical computers typically have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Central Processing Unit (CPU)</a>.
The CPU is in charge of carrying out arithmetic, logical, controlling and input/output (I/O) operations specified on the instructions.
Modern CPUs are microprocessors, where the CPU is contained on a single metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) integrated circuit (IC) chip.
Computers don't understand words or numbers the way humans do and at the lowest level everything is represented by a binary electrical signal that registers two states: on and off.
The CPU is one of the pieces that takes complicated data and decodes it into binary.

### Binary

<img class="section-jumbo" src="https://commithub.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/blog-posts/quantum-computers-explained/binary.jpg" alt="Binary" />

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Binary Numbers</a> is a number expressed in a base-2 numeral system.
Usually 0 (zero) and 1 (one). Computers use binary because in the early days of computers electrical currents were harder to measure and control very precisely.
Having an "on" state represented by a negative charge and an "off" state represented by a positive charge made more sense.
The reason why the "on" state is represented by a negative charge is because electrons are represented by a negative charge.
More electrons means more current with a negative charge. In binary we represent the "on" state with a 1 and the "of" state with a 0.
The early computers were way bulkier that what we have now but we've kept the same fundamental principles.

### Transistors

<img class="section-jumbo" src="https://commithub.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/blog-posts/quantum-computers-explained/transistors.png" alt="Transistors" />

A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Transistor</a> is a semiconductor device used to amplify or switch electronical signals and electrical power.
It's composed by semiconductor material usually with at least three terminals to connect to an external circuit.
Transistors act like a switch turning on and off the current. This is where binary comes in.
The transistor is a fundamental building block for all electronics making devices smaller and cheaper to manufacter revolutionizing the world of electronics paving the way for smaller smaller computers.
Compared to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Vacuum Tubes</a>, transistors are smaller and require less power to operate.
Transistors are primarily used in the CPU to perform mathematical calculation and a series of transistors may also be used as a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_gate" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Logic Gate</a> when performing logical operations.
Modern CPUs contain millions of transistors that are microscopic in size.

### Moore's Law

<img class="section-jumbo" src="https://commithub.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/blog-posts/quantum-computers-explained/mooreslaw.png" alt="Moore's Law Graph" />

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Moore's Law</a> is the observation that the number of transistors in a integrated circuit doubles every two years.
The observation was named after Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Fairchild Semiconductor and was CEO of Intel. Moore's prediction proved accurate for several decades and has been used in the
semiconductor industry to guide long-term planning and to set targets for research and development (R&D). Moore's law is an observation and projection of a historical trend but it's not
a physical or natural law. The rate held steady from 1975 until around 2012.

### Limitations of the Classical Computer

Moore's Law has held strong over the years making transistors smaller and smaller to fit into a CPU.
Transistors have gotten as small as 10 nanometers, that the channel that carries the electrical current through the transistor cannot always contain it.
The trend is already starting to slow down because we face a physical limitation due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_tunnelling" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Quantum Tunneling</a>.
