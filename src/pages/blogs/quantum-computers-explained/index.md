Computers are a tool that have transformed the way we work from storing information, better processes to work with that data and allowing us to easily share the data.
The conception of this amazing tool started the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Revolution" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Digital Revolution</a>.
This lead to a race to make computers more friendly to the consumer by reducing their size as years go by.
Now in 2020 we have smartphones that have 12GB of RAM and a processor that runs at 2.5GHz.
It's truly phenomenal all the progress we have made but technology has a limit.
Let's explore first what is the classical computer to get an understanding on why quantum computers were conceived.

## Classical Computer

A classical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Computers</a> or just computer
(It's called classical to identify that it's a standard computer and not a quantum computer) it's a device that follows instructions to achieve a task.
With computer programming we can tell create logical operations pretty much telling the computer what to do and in what order.
Programs are a result of that programming that when run it follows the operations specified in the program.
The early applications of a computer were for simple calculations and in essence even computers today are just a bunch of simple calculations.
