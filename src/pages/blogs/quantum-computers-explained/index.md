Computers are a tool that have transformed the way we work from storing information, better processes to work with that data and allowing us to easily share the data.
The conception of this amazing tool started the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Revolution" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Digital Revolution</a>.
This lead to a race to make computers more friendly to the consumer by reducing their size as years go by.
